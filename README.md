Welcome to the GitHub repository of our meticulously crafted Advanced Financial Analysis of Bike Sales project. In this comprehensive analysis, we delve deep into the world of bike sales, leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and strategic financial modeling to unravel valuable insights.

Key Highlights:

1/ Data Precision and DAX Mastery:

Rectified discrepancies in crucial columns (profit, cost, revenue) using advanced DAX functions, ensuring precise and reliable data.
Utilized intricate DAX structures to recalculate variable expenses based on revenue ratios, providing in-depth financial insights.

2/ Geographic and Demographic Insights:

Resolved data inconsistencies, ensuring accurate geographic analysis, including correcting "Nord" representing Burkina Faso, not France.
Analyzed demographic trends, identifying top-profit countries and high-value age groups, guiding targeted marketing strategies.

3/ Strategic Financial Integration:

Integrated financial data, forecasting Fixed Expenses with a 5% annual increase, and calculated precise KPIs, including the Break-even Point and Net Profit Margin.
Conducted detailed research to identify Fixed Expenses and Operating Expenses for subcategories, recognizing real-world variations while maintaining the underlying conceptual framework.
Explored detailed financial metrics, offering a granular view of operational efficiency and profitability.

4/ In-Depth Market Analysis:

Identified high-profit categories and products, offering actionable insights for market optimization.
Discovered significant disparities in subcategories like "Jerseys," where high costs and low profits indicate the need for removal due to inadequate demand and very high production cost.
Evaluated the "Caps" subcategory, recognizing its acceptable performance. Recommended a slight price increase to enhance profitability given its higher production cost.

5/ YOY Net Profit Analysis (2011-2016):

Conducted extensive YOY net profit analysis, enabling trend mapping and data-driven decision-making.
